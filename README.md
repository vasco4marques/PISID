# ISCTE - Projeto de Integração de Sistemas de Informação Distribuído

In this project we had to gather data from a laboratory through a MQTT publish and subscribe mechanism and store it in a NoSQL (MongoDB database). After this, data would be sent between two diferent computers into a MySQL database.
With this MySQL database, we created a HTML page with php to be able to start, setup and watch the history of the experiments in the laboratory. 
We also created an Android APP in order to watch data in real time inside an experiment.
